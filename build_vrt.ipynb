    "# Create a Statewide Virtual Raster (VRT) from Multiple Raster Tile Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a **statewide Virtual Raster (VRT)** by combining multiple raster tiles from several folders into a single mosaic reference file (option 1). A second script (option 2, commented out below) offers an option for if data is organized in a single folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a VRT instead of a single merged GeoTIFF allows you to:\n",
    "- Work with large raster datasets without creating a large physical file  \n",
    "- Visualize or process all tiles as if they were one continuous raster  \n",
    "- Save disk space and time, since the VRT references existing source tiles instead of duplicating data  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a VRT?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Virtual Raster (VRT)** is a lightweight XML file that acts as a “virtual mosaic.”  \n",
    "Rather than storing data, it references the original raster tiles and describes how they fit together spatially.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the **CT GIS Office**, statewide raster data is organized into four blocks that divide the state into separate sections, and the data is organized in separate folders. When performing statewide analyses, we often need to combine these block-based tiles into one seamless dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a VRT lets us:\n",
    "- Avoid data duplication  \n",
    "- Maintain a lightweight statewide reference file for analysis  \n",
    "- Efficiently repeat the process with other statewide raster datasets  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "- Python 3.8+  \n",
    "- [GDAL library](https://gdal.org/download.html) with Python bindings  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Each folder should contain raster `.tif` tiles that cover a portion (or “block”) of the state or region.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example structure:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Block_01/\n",
    "├── tile_01.tif\n",
    "├── tile_02.tif\n",
    "Block_02/\n",
    "├── tile_03.tif\n",
    "├── tile_04.tif\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the `input_folders` list in the script to match your local file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "See _Option 2_ below if data is contained within a single folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this process is a `.vrt` file, a lightweight XML file that references all input tiles.  \n",
    "You can open and use the `.vrt` directly in GIS software such as **QGIS** or **ArcGIS Pro** for visualization or further processing/analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes and Best Practices\n",
    "- Ensure all input tiles use the same **CRS**, **resolution**, and **data type**  \n",
    "- This process **does not** reproject or resample tiles; it assumes consistent alignment  \n",
    "- Avoid using special characters or spaces in output file paths  \n",
    "\n",
